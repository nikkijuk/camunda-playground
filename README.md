bpm for programmers?

## Camunda

Camunda BPM as example of BPMN based workflow automation toolset. 

Camunda BPM can be used as standalone installation or embedded within host applications.

Camunda BPM was forked 2013 from open source library Activiti https://www.activiti.org/. 

Activiti is commercially available as part of Alfresco suite https://www.alfresco.com/platform/process-services-bpm

Camunda BPM is offered as Open Source (apache license), commercial version adds monitoring and optimization features https://camunda.com/enterprise/

Camunda as company has recently (12/2018) raised 25 million euros of venture capital https://blog.camunda.com/post/2018/12/camunda-raises-series-a/

Camunda develops also new lightweight Workflow engine for microservices https://zeebe.io/

From my standpoint it look like Camunda as company and Camunda BPM have some strong points

- Rooted on experiences from consuling service
- Current offer fullfills standards of OMG namely BPMN, DMN & CMMN
- Event based microservices use cases are covered by Camunda BPM (mature) and soon performance optimized witb Zeebe (bleeding edge)
